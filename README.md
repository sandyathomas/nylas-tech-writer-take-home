# Nylas Technical Writer Take Home

Thanks for taking the time to complete the Nylas take-home. :tada:

The take-home consists of 2 parts:

* Writing sample
* API exercise;  Nylas is an API company, after all. 

## Writing Sample

Provide a link to your favorite thing you've ever written. It does not have to be documentation related or technical in any way.

## API Exercise

@tjperry 

1. Go to: https://github.com/nylas/nylas-tech-writer-take-home/pull/1.
2. View API documentation for 'Creating a new pet' in comments section.

Explain how to create a new `Pet` using the provided documentation below. 

### Proposed Endpoint Add a new Pet

**Example Payload**

application/json

name is required to make a pet

```text
{
  "category": { //what category the pet belongs to
    "name": "string", //category name
    "sub": {
      "prop1": "string" //maybe a sub category for the pet
    }
  },
  "name": "Guru", //pet name
  "photoUrls": [
    "string" // phots of the pet. We aren't going to store images, so provide a URL
  ],
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "string" //let them provide their tags as a way to organize the pets
    }
  ],
  "status": "available", //is the pet avail for adoptions. can also have pending_adoption and adopted.
  "petType": "cat", //what type of pet. Let's start with cat, dog, rabbit and fish. add more as we get feedback.
}
```

**Endpoint**

http://api.nylas.com/pet


**Returns**

Should return 200 Created and 405 Invalid Input

**Auth**
Let's stay with Bearer auth using the access_token with scopes of `write:pets` and `read:pets`.


## Bonus

Use the [Open API 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) specification to document the endpoint.
